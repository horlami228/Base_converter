BASE CONVERTER:
===============
A number base is the number of digits or combination of digits that a system uses to represent numbers.

---------------------
---------------------
This program is a Base Conveter

Operations include:
==================
1. Base2 to Base10 (Binary to Decimal)
2. Base10 to Base16 (Decimal to Hexa-decmial)
3. Base16 to Base2 (Hexa-decimal to Binary)
4. Base2 to Base16 (Binary to Hexa-decimal)
5. Base10 to Base2 (Binary to Deciaml)
6. Base16 to Base10 (Hexa-decimal to Decimal)

Binary Numbers - This a base-2 number system invented by Gottfried Leibniz that's made up of only two numbers or digits: 0 (zero) and 1 (one).
The 0s and 1s in binary represent OFF or ON, respectively. In a transistor, a "0" represents no flow of electricity, and a "1" represents electricity is allowed to flow.

Decimal Numbers - The decimal system consists of 10 single-digit numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

Hexadecimal Numbers - Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. In this system there are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters. A, B, C, D, E and F. Representing 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 respectively.

How to Compile
==============
Use gcc *c -lm -o /file_name/

Usage:
==========================
(1) Choose option to convert from
(2) Choose option to convert to
(3) Enter a valid number
(4) The correct output will be displayed for the user
(5) User can decide to try again to convert or just end the program there.
